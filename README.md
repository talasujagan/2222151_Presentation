Application Language -> Java
Tooling ->	Maven
Data structures and Algorithms -> Data structures and Algorithms
Database Access ->	SQL

Write a program for Tweet App with below guidelines:

2.	Use below details while registration:
	a.	first_name (required)
	b.	last_name (optional)
	c.	gender (required)

DEBUGGING & TROUBLESHOOTING:
1.	As the programmer I should:
	a.	Debug & Troubleshoot the code which has bugs with breakpoints / pause 
	b.	Ensure optimal resource utilization & close unneeded connections
	c.	Ensure all unhandled exceptions are addressed 
	d.	Query the database only for the necessary information (user info/tweets etc) with proper indexes & order.

RUBRICS/EXPECTED DELIVERABLES:

•	Implement java 8 features – lambda, stream, map, etc.
•	Java Project must be a Maven Project
•	Project must be initiated using Maven CLI
•	Email id should be used as username/userid
•	Use db.properties to store database parameters.
•	Package Structure for project will be like com.tweetapp.* with proper naming conventions for package and beans.
•	Use dao layer, service layer.
•	Use proper layering – database interaction code should be only in DAO classes. DAO classes should not have UI/Business logic. Service classes will have all the business logic.
•	Input validations must be handled
•	Use custom exception and show a valid error message to user if something goes wrong.
•	Use java data structure algorithm to reset password. 
•	Build the project.

SUPPORT GUIDELINES:
1.	Application shall be a java console application
2.	Application must be menu driven
3.	Application will comprise of two menu
	a.	Introduction menu for Non-logged in user
		i.	Register
		ii.	Login
		iii.	Forgot Password
	b.	Menu for logged in user

		iii.	View all tweets
		iv.	View All Users
		v.	Reset Password
		vi.	Logout 
4.	Menu must show iteratively after every operation
